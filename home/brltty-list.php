We offer a special invitation to the developers of braille displays.
It's our goal to support as many models as possible within the Linux/Unix environment.
While we always do as much as we can toward this end,
we'd be even more effective with your help.
The most important thing we need is the details regarding
the communication protocol(s) of your braille display(s).
If you prefer to contact us privately for this sort of thing
then we invite you to send e-mail to any member(s) of
<?php write_link("#team", "The BRLTTY Team"); ?>.
