Attributes Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: prologue.rst

Files with names of the form ``*.atb`` are attributes tables, and with names of
the form ``*.ati`` are attributes subtables. They are used when BRLTTY is
displaying screen attributes rather than screen content. Each of the eight
braille dots represents one of the eight VGA attribute bits. They can usually
be found in the ``/etc/brltty/Attributes/`` directory (see |README.Customize|
for more details).

An attributes table consists of a sequence of directives, one per line, which 
define how combinations of VGA attributes are to be represented in braille. 
UTF-8 character encoding must be used. White-space (blanks, tabs) at the 
beginning of a line, as well as before and/or after any operand of any 
directive, is ignored. Lines containing only white-space are ignored. If the 
first non-white-space character of a line is ``#`` then that line is a comment 
and is ignored.

Directives
==========

The Dot Directive
-----------------

.. parsed-literal:: dot *dot* *state* # *comment*

Use this directive to specify what a specific dot represents. The default is
that all dots are down and not used to represent anything.

*dot*
   The dot being defined. It is a single digit within the range ``1``-``8`` as
   defined by the standard braille dot numbering convention (see 
   |README.BrailleDots| for details).

*state*
   What the dot being defined represents. It may be:

   =attribute
      The dot is raised if the named attribute is on.

   ~attribute
      The dot is raised if the named attribute is off.

The attributes are:
