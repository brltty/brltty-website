<p>
BRLTTY can be installed from Google Play.
This is what we recommend because, doing it this way, you'll automatically get new releases, important fixes, etc.
You can either search for it by name - i.e. for <q>brltty</q> (without the quotes) -
or go directly to its App page:

<ul>
<li><?php write_link("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.a11y.brltty.android"); ?></li>
</ul>
