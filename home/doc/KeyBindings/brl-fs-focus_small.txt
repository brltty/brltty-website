Key Table: FreedomScientific Focus Blue
=======================================

Notes
* There are two Nav controls - one at each side of the top.
  Each has three actions: Up, Down, and Press.
  On some models, a Nav control is a wheel which can be both rolled and pressed.
  On others, it's an up/down rocker along with a separate pressable button.
* The Selector keys are at either end of the front edge.
  On older models, they're known as GDF (General Display Function) keys.
* The Advance keys are just inside the rockers and outside the shift keys.
